            <p>Colorado is known as the centennial state because it was the 38th state founded in 1876. More often though you will hear it called the mile high which refers to the fact the fact
              that Denver is located 5,280 ft. above sea level. This is low altitude for the state as a good portion of the state is much higher elevation than that. Nestled against the Rocky Mountains
              the state is know for its towering mountains and lifestyle that goes with proximity to them.
            </p>
            <p>As you explore the frontrange and the mountains themselves you will be able to enjoy the great recreation that mountain living offers in all four seasons. Whether you like to hike or
              go back country snow boarding, there is something for everyone in this beautiful and scenic state. Contrary to what many think though the state is also known to have sunshine most days of the year
              due to its high elevation and dry climate. So although it snows plenty during the winter months, you are hard pressed to not enjoy a day with at least a little bit of sunshine.
            </p>
            <p>Colorado is a wonderful state to be in. From the spacious cities that you'll rarely feel crowded in, to its mountain peaks where you can see for miles and miles in any direction. There is so much
              to do and see and feel relaxed the whole way. There is surely beauty to be found by anyone that would decide to visit this beautiful state.
