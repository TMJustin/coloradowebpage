              <h2>City Overview</h2>
              <p>Colorado would be imcomplete without mention of its incredible mountain towns and resorts. Steamboat Springs is one these destinations and is hugely popular for residents and tourists alike. The small population of <span class="highlight">13,244</span> is pretty indicative of the size of many mountain towns,
                but, Steamboat also sees thousands and thousands of tourists every year who come to partake in the recreation and relaxation that Steamboat Springs offers. While many resort towns are known for the busy season during the winter in which many people come to ski and snowboard, Steamboat also
                sees as lot of tourism in the Summer when those same slopes are used for hiking and mountain biking. Relaxation and recreation await anyone who finds themselves in Steamboat Springs. The city has been a staple destination for Coloradoans and out of state tourists since it was founded in <span class="highlight">1900</span>.

              <h2>Region and Economy</h2>
              <p>Steamboat is located a few hours from Denver in the north-western area of the state in the <span class="highlight">Yampa Valley</span>. Luckily the scenic drive through the Rockies is worth the three hour trip
              from Denver. Many of Colorado's mountain towns aren't that populated in terms of long time residents but as tourism sites they bring in a lot of money and primarily have economies that are based on that tourism. The
              average income that is enjoyed in Steamboat for year round residents is about <span class="highlight">$93,280</span>.

                and many will also come in warmer times to enjoy mountain biking and hiking or climbing. But the city of Steamboat has other offerings besides the surrounding mountains.
