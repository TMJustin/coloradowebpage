              <h2>City Overview</h2>
              <p>Golden is a city on the outskirts of Denver and nested up against the frontrange of the Rocky Mountains. Golden is well known for its history as an old mining town and famously as the home of the Coors brewery. With a population of only <span class="highlight">20,399</span> people,
                Golden is much smaller than Denver a lot more indicative of the mountain town feel that is common around the state of Colorado. Golden is perfectly placed to give visitors and residents access to many different areas of the state depending on what
                activities people are interested in. Golden is in close proximity to Denver and Boulder which are great cities to take in city life but also very close to lots of great outdoor areas and the mountains themselves. This city is draped in history as one of the foremost
                gold mining towns that popped up when this region was first settled during the gold rush. Golden was actually the first capitol city for the Colorado territory when it was first settled in <span class="highlight">1859</span>. Many people will live in Golden and the surrounding area to attend the
                Colorado School of Mines which has had its home in Golden since 1870.

              <h2>Region and Economy</h2>
              <p>Golden is a lovely suburban area located just outside of Denver and nestled up against the <span class="highlight">front range area</span> of the Rocky Mountains. This allows really wonderful views of the foothills as well as the surrouding mountain areas that include lookout mountain and north
                table mountain. Due to its proximity the economy of Golden includes a lot of graduates from the School of Mines who work in the engineering industry. The medium income therefore is pretty high at <span class="highlight">$90,990</span>. Golden is considered a bit high for living
                expense in the area but it is not all that uncommon to see in this beautiful area.

              <h2>Tourism and Activities</h2>
              <p>One of the things that makes Golden such a good place to be is that there are a ton of things to do and see in and around the city. With its close proximity to the rocky mountains as well as table mountain, there are a lot of great outdoor areas to see.
                From great hikes to golf and outdoor sports or just general site seeing there is something for everyone here. The dining scene is also well established in this small city. Whether you are looking for something casual or trying to have a memorable fine dining experience
                there is something for every type of person. The big attraction that most will not want to miss is the Coors brewery located in Golden. This iconic brewery is one of the largest beer producers in the United States and no trip to Golden would be complete without
