              <h2>City Overview</h2>
              <p>Denver is the capitol city of Colorado. As the only true main urban hub of Colorado, Denver is unique in its size and access to city lifestyle. With a population of around <span class="highlight">715,522 people</span>,
                Denver is far and away the most poplulous area of Colorado. The city still provides a good indicator of its history of a western mining town that was settled during the Pike's Peak gold rush in <span class="highlight">1858</span>. The governing bodies of Colorado work hard to preserve
              the history of the city. Even though its a large urban area, people living in Denver enjoy its "small city" feel and its access to surrounding outdoor areas and especially the Rocky Mountains. For those who are staying in the city there is really
            great access to different cultural activities and dining. Denver is also home to many sports teams and arenas, and Denverites are typically pretty diehard fans for local teams.

              <h2>Region and Economy</h2>
              <p>Denver is located directly east of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains which make up the <span class="highlight">front range area</span> of the state. Most of the biggest cities and populated areas lie in this area of the state. This makes Denver a great place to be for those who like to have fairly good access to the
                mountains and also move north and south along the front range to other popular cities in the state. The average income in denver
              is <span class="highlight">$88,213</span> which is indicative of the city lifestyle that is enjoyed here.
